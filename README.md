# NodeJs1_Assignment

About NodeJs :
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment and library for running web applications outside the client's browser. Ryan Dahl developed it in 2009, and its latest iteration, version 15.14, was released in April 2021. Developers use Node.js to create server-side web applications, and it is perfect for data-intensive applications since it uses an asynchronous, event-driven model.

Features of NodeJs are :
1. Asynchronous in Nature and Event driven
2. Single Threaded Architecture
3. Scalable
4. Compatibility on the cross platforms
5. Fast Data Streaming
6. No Buffering
